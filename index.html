<!--Welcome to "Projects Fuego..." Just follow along with comments like this one, and you'll design a really cool webtext that not only introduces you, your skills, and interests to the rest of the class, but also builds your coding literacy. Refer to the repository README for GitHub publishing help.-->

<!--BTW. You can leave these faded code comments be, or delete them. Programmers and web designers use these comments to better explain what the code is doing for others who may enter the document later. They are but road signs, absent from the larger design-->

<!--HTML pages start by calling <!DOCTYPE html> and designating a language.-->
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
  <!--Next comes the <head> information including the title and all of the important links that make the webtext work. When a browser access your url, it looks first at the index.html document <head> to learn about the names and locations of the other files and assets it will need to assemble your code into a visual display.-->

  <!--Go ahead and fill in the blank in <title>I am...</title> (see just below). The <title> will appear in your document's browser tab-->
<title>I am... Jordan!</title>
<!--The stuff below the title does important work to tell browsers what this page should look like on different screens-->
<meta charset="UTF-8">
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">
<!--Next is a link to the cascading style sheet or CSS. Web designers use a cascading stylesheet CSS to add styling to a website. Designers do this by "calling" a <div class> in HTML and defining the class attributes on the style sheet. Doing so saves time and results in less code. On the style.css page you'll find attributes relating font, text size, image size, among other details.-->
<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="style.css">
</head>


<body>
<!--Now we will start working in the body of the document. The body holds all of the code and content that will appear as a visual for our audience.-->

<!--Designers refer to this next section as a "Hero Image." The hero image is styled on the style.css page by calling a "class." To replace the hero image, simply place a .jpg file in the same file folder (directory) as this project and name it "hero.jpg." Alternatively, if you are working with a .png, you will need to open the style.css file using your text editor, find the "hero-image" class and change the file type from ".jpg" to ".png."" Browsers will only work with .jpg, .jpeg, or .png images. Since hero images need to stretch across the screen, typically you will want to select an image 1200px in width to allow quick load time yet avoid pixilation.-->


<div class="hero-image">
  <div class="hero-text">

<!--We'll use this first section to discuss where you are right now. Where do you go to school and what courses are you taking/enjoying. What majors/minors/certificates are you pursuing? Has this changed? Why? Replace the content between <h3> and </h3> that says "Lorem ipsum" etc -->


<!--Fuego programs sometimes use "in-line styling" to provide quick fixes to content design. In the above case, you could change "left" to "right" or "center" depending on your specific design needs. That said, left align is usually best practice for improving readability.-->

  <h2>My Studies</h2>
  <h3>I am a senior at Pitt double majoring in Communication Rhetoric and Media & Professional Communications and minoring in Studio Arts. I am curious, question a lot of things, and love to write and create. I am particularly interested in the rhetoric of advocacy efforts, how social initiatives develop online, and media and rhetorical ethics. My majors and minor have allowed me to connect my interests through research, writing, and artistic endeavors (mostly digital, some physical).</h3>

<!--Replace the images here. You can also control max-image width%. Keep your file names simple, don't use spaces, and be case sensitive). Be sure to add alt="text." Visually impaired individuals using screen readers rely on alt="text" to describe pictures to them. Describe your image as clearly and succinctly as possible.-->

<!--What experience do you have to leverage in this class? Are you a writer, are you a maker, are you a thinker or critic? What is your medium/media? What interests you about that medium/those media? What media/skills do you wish to learn more about/pursue in this class?-->

<div class="textblock" style="text-align: left">
  <h2>Knowledge, Tools, and Skills</h2>
    <h3>I would consider myself a maker, thinker, and critic above all, and a writer when the moment strikes. I often struggle to find a balance between these sides of myself. I worked doing creative at an advertising agency for 8 months where I got to practice many facets of digital creation and got to know a bunch of Adobe creative software quite well. Much of my work there was graphic design focused, but I also had the opportunity to write scripts, edit audio and video advertisements, and practice some animation. I've been working on a research project for the past year which has given me a chance to practice my writing skills, but I don't have nearly as much fun with that. I hope to further develop my audio and video creation and editing skills in this course, and work with those skills more artistically than practically.  </h3>

<!--Quick fact: Did you know "Lorem ipsum," the fill text used in this web template, was hacked out of Cicero's "De finibus bonorum et malorum"? Developers made it non-sensical, so don't bother with Google Translate.-->

<!--So, what exactly are you into? Take some time to explain your interest...what you will pursue in this class. What is it, define it, why is it important/significant, how do you intend to approach this subject matter?-->
<div class="textblock" style="text-align: left">
  <h2>Potential Project</h2>
      <h3>I am incredibly interested in law and policy, media ethics, and how these topics and conversations will continue to evolve in the digital age. I think there are important questions to ask when considering the relationship between people and technology. In a photography class, I made  a quick project that questioned the ethics of street photography, and it sparked futher thought for me on what it means to live in a society where we are constantly surveilled, what privacy means in the 21st century, etc. etc. There's a lot to work though there and much more research to be done on my end. I hope this course provides an outlet for me to further consider those questions.

<!--Let's talk a little about the future. After school what kind of job or career would you like to pursue? What is your reasoning for going on this path?

   <h2>In the Future</h2>
      <h3>Post-graduation I plan to work in advertising doing creative for a few years. I can see myself working towards becoming a creative director, but I don't think this is what I want to do longterm. Ideally I will go back to school, for what I am not sure. I have considered a masters in media communications or going to law school because either of these spaces would allow me to further immerse myself in topics that I find interesting and important. Either are a big commitment though so I need some time to figure all that out. </h3>
